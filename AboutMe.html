        		<h1>About me...</h1>
        			<P>I'm a dude from Madison WI, working as a developer yet learning how to code by making crap like this.  Wacky right?!?</P>
					<p>I learned to code primarily in vb.net and java about 100 years ago.  I learned a little web development while in school about 100 years ago.  We coded raw html using notepad.  NOTEPAD!!!!
					</br>
					For my final semester, I had a single course in javascript which just touched on things like Ajax and jQuery.  It seemed like some kind of black magic voo-doo s#it.  To be honest, it still does.  
					</p>
					<P>Since that time, most of my work has been on Windows services and client applications, but very very very little web work with any sort of user interface.  That serves as my disclaimer for why this website looks as it does.
					</P>
